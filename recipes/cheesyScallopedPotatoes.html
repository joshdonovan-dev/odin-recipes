    <p>The most cheesy and delectable potatoe dish I have ever come across</p>
    <h2>Indgredients</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>5 LB bag of red potatoes</li>
                <li>1 LB of Butter (not margarine!)</li>
                <li> milk or half & half</li>
                <li> lb. American cheese (Land o’ Lakes or other deli style)</li>
            </ul>
        
    <h2>Directions</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Preheat oven to 350-degrees</li>
                <li>Peel, rinse and dry 5 lb. bag of red potatoes</li>
                <li>Using a mandolin, slice the potatoes thinly into a bowl</li>
                <li>Butter a 9 x 12 baking dish</li>
                <li>Place 1 layer of thinly sliced potatoes on bottom of dish, overlapping the edges (like fanning out a deck of cards)</li>
                <li>On top of that, add 6-8 pats of butter and salt (spread out)</li>
                <li>On top of that, add 4-5 slices of American cheese (spread out)</li>
                <li>On top of that, splash small amount of milk (about ¼ cup)</li>
                <li>Repeat the layering with the potatoes, butter, salt, cheese and milk until the casserole dish is filled to near the top – ending with a layer of cheese.</li>
                <li>Cover with aluminum foil and bake for about 45 minutes to 1 hour</li>
                <li>(Hint: You may want to place a cookie sheet or a piece of aluminum foil on the oven rack under the rack that the casserole dish is on to catch any spills as the potatoes bake - especially if your dish is filled to the top)</li>
                <li>After the initial cooking, carefully remove the foil from the dish and bake for an additional 30 minutes until the liquid is cooked out and the top is slightly browned and bubbly.</li>
                <li>Let potatoes sit for about 10-15 minutes before serving.</li>
