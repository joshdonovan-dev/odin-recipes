    <img src="../images/GrammyInTheKitchen.jpeg"alt="A picture of a grandmother in the kitchen on the phone">

    <p>My full blood italian great grandmother named Michaelna recived this recipe from her grandmother. This sauce has been passed down from generation from generation before they immigrated to America. This sauce had its origin in Naples and feeds about 10-15 people</p>

    <h2>Tomato Basil Sauce</h2>
    <p>Over medium heat, add enough olive oil to coat the base of a very large, non-stick sauce/stock pot. Add fresh garlic cloves, being careful not to burn them.</p>
    
    <h3>Full Recipe</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2-3 pork spare ribs (bone-in country ribs)</li>
        <li>Sweet Italian sausage (5 pack)</li>
        <li>Hot Italian sausage (5 pack)</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>Half Recipe</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1-2 ribs</li>
        <li>2-3 sausage links of each type</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>Season the pork and sausage meat with:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Salt</li>
        <li>Pepper</li>
        <li>Garlic powder</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>Cook all the meat until browned, then remove from the pot, retaining the oil and fat rendered from the meat during cooking. Set the meat aside in a large bowl. This meat and its juices will go back into the sauce once the meatballs have cooked and firmed up for about one hour.</p>
    
    <h3>Full Recipe</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Three 29-ounce cans of Red Pack Tomato Puree</li>
        <li>One 12-ounce can of Contadina Tomato Paste</li>
        <li>2/3 of a can of water from each 29-ounce can of puree</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>Half Recipe</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 cans of Red Pack Tomato Puree</li>
        <li>6 ounces of Contadina Tomato Paste</li>
        <li>2/3 of a can of water from each 29-ounce can of puree</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>Add to the sauce:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Oregano (dried)</li>
        <li>Fresh basil (fresh or dried)</li>
        <li>Parmesan cheese (to taste)</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>Once hot, the meatballs can be added to cook for about one hour. After an hour, return the pork and sausage to the sauce and let it continue cooking for another 1-2 hours or until done.</p>
    
    <h2>Meatballs</h2>
    
    <h3>Full Recipe</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 Â½ lbs ground meat</li>
        <li>4 eggs</li>
        <li>Salt, garlic powder, parsley flakes, parmesan cheese</li>
        <li>Progresso Bread Crumbs</li>
    </ul> 
    
    <h3>Half Recipe</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Approximately 1.25 lbs ground meat</li>
        <li>2 eggs</li>
        <li>Salt, garlic powder, parsley flakes, parmesan cheese</li>
        <li>Progresso Bread Crumbs</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>Mix ingredients together, ensuring a dry mixture by adding lots of breadcrumbs and cheese. Roll meatballs and place them into the pot of hot tomato sauce to cook for about one hour, stirring gently so they do not stick to the bottom of the pot.</p>
    
    <p><em>Recipe captured many years ago by Dianne (Donovan) Lutz when she joined her Grandmother Michelina Corrado in the kitchen of her home in Sharpsburg, PA, as she made her famous sauce. Nunnie, as she was called, made her sauce for a delicious pasta dinner every Sunday for her family, which included her husband Domenic, her two children Donna Donovan and John Corrado, her seven grandchildren, and ultimately, her many great-grandchildren.</em></p>
